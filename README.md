The final task was to create a predictive model using scikit-learn for classification or prediction. I chose to work on a spam email detection dataset. I began by preprocessing the data using pandas and sklearn utilities, transforming text data into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer. Then, I trained a Naive Bayes classifier to classify emails as spam or not. The model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, all visualized in a Jupyter Notebook. This task solidified my understanding of the machine learning workflow: from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation. Although I used a Jupyter Notebook for final presentation, I performed all data preparation and testing in VS Code/ Intell IJ IDEA before transferring it for visualization and output formatting.
